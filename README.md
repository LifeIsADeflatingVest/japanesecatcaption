# japanesecatcaption
This is a silly, not-meant-to-be-taken-seriously idea I had watching the way YouTube translates Japanese into English â€” particularly cat videos, which are among my favorite :grinning:	
The file returns a random cat photo from Flickr's public catalogue, together with an emulation of what Japanese-translated-into-English usually looks like on YouTube. It's ungrammatical, often not sense-making, and Japanese onomatopoeia is not translated. If you've seen any such videos on YouTube, you'll recognize it instantly.

*Disclaimer:* The code searches Flickr for photos using "cat" as a keyword. But this depends **entirely** on users uploading the correct tag. I have absolutely zero control of what kind of photos might pop up, and assume no responsibility, so be warned! :grin:
